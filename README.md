# teamsmartycodeone2015

Added this Readme file just now. The rest of the code is from yesterday before 6pm. 

Steps:

1. $ git clone git@github.com:sohchy/teamsmartycodeone2015.git
2. If you haven't installed ionic before, you can look up ionicframework.com/getting-started (or do $ npm install -g cordova ionic) 
3. If you want to just see it on the browser you can do ionic serve --lab
4. If you want to run the app on the browser as a platform you can do ionic platform add browser, and then ionic run browser
5. If you want to run it on ios, ionic platform add ios, ionic build ios, ionic run ios
6. If you want to run it on android, ionic platform add android, ionic build android, ionic run android

From our experience, its best to run android version on a device. So instead of ionic run android, after you do ionic build android you can find the apk file at platforms/android/build/outputs/apk/android-debug.apk

We put the code up using hockeyapp and an enterprise license (needed for ios) so anybody can download it.

ios: bit.do/fnb16ios
android: bit.do/fnb16android

The app doesn't work throughout, that means all the links in the app aren't live and working. The app workflow was designed for the presentation as we wanted to focus on the story we wanted to tell. I've added a workflow from the presentation here if it helps.

1.Open App
2. Select Login 
3. Try It (Get Started screen)
4. My Budget screen, at the bottom: Would you like to explore some options?
5. Payday Loans card - click here
6. Scroll down in the Payday loans screen, and in the Local resources card, click here
7. Scroll down in the Local Resources screen, Jump 1 month
8. Woohoo! screen, Would you like to start?
9. Scroll down in the My Budget screen, Would you like to save some more?
10. Put away money for bills card, Try it
11. Scroll down Vault screen, Jump 3 months
12. Woohoo! screen Check out your budget status

These links are working but wasn't part of the presentation

From 12, you can scroll down to and click Would you like to save some more and it takes you to Goals. And then you can click on Home (saving for a home that is). You'll reach the Goal Home screen. You can scroll down to the 'Home' link to get back to the My Budget screen.

Also, from 12, you can click on Toolbox (please note Toolbox works only after you have reached Step 12). And click on Ask Me. If you want to get back to the My Budget screen, you can scroll down that Toolbox screen and click on 'Home'.

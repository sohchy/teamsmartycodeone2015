# teamsmartycodeone2015

Added this Readme file just now. The rest of the code is from yesterday before 6pm. 

Steps:

1. $ git clone git@github.com:sohchy/teamsmartycodeone2015.git
2. If you haven't installed ionic before, you can look up ionicframework.com/getting-started (or do $ npm install -g cordova ionic) 
3. If you want to just see it on the browser you can do ionic serve --lab
4. If you want to run the app on the browser as a platform you can do ionic platform add browser, and then ionic run browser
5. If you want to run it on ios, ionic platform add ios, ionic build ios, ionic run ios
6. If you want to run it on android, ionic platform add android, ionic build android, ionic run android

From our experience, its best to run android version on a device. So instead of ionic run android, after you do ionic build android you can find the apk file at platforms/android/build/outputs/apk/android-debug.apk

We put the code up using hockeyapp and an enterprise license (needed for ios) so anybody can download it.

ios: bit.do/fnb16ios
android: bit.do/fnb16android
